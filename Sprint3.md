# Sprint - 3 Front End Enhancements

## Overview
This sprint introduced significant improvements in the front end, focusing on enhancing the review functionality, restructuring the codebase for better reusability, and integrating centralized state management. These updates set the stage for upcoming features that will further improve user experience and code maintainability.

## New Features

### Review Book Section
- **Add, Update & Delete Reviews:** Logged-in users can now add reviews for existing books. They can also update or delete their own reviews.
- **Public Viewing:** All users can view reviews added by different members.
- **User-Specific Actions:** If logged in with the same ID as the review author, users are empowered to modify or remove their reviews.

### Backend Integration & Testing
- **API Integration:** Seamlessly integrated with backend APIs to support review functionalities.
- **Testing:** Conducted thorough unit testing and end-to-end testing to ensure the reliability of the new features.

### UI Enhancements & Navigation
- **Book Categories:** Added categories for books to streamline browsing.
- **UI Alignment:** Adjusted the user interface for improved visual consistency and user experience.

### State Management
- **Redux Integration:** Implemented Redux for centralized state management. This setup will be particularly beneficial for handling extensive user data in upcoming feature implementations.

## Code Refactoring & Componentization
- **Decoupling Components:** Broke down tightly coupled code into loosely coupled, reusable components.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** This modular approach improves the overall maintainability of the application and prepares the codebase for future enhancements.

## Upcoming Enhancements

- **User Role Differentiation:**
  - Implement clear differentiation between reader and author accounts.
- **Access Restrictions:**
  - Restrict the ability to add books exclusively to users with author accounts.
- **Section-Wise Book Fetching:**
  - Develop an end-to-end feature for fetching books by sections.
- **Further Code Optimization:**
  - Refactor code to eliminate hardcoded values and improve overall code quality.

## Conclusion
The sprint has paved the way for a more scalable and maintainable front end, with robust testing and a cleaner code structure. The planned enhancements will further enrich user interactions and streamline content management in future releases.

This endpoint allows new users to create an account. It accepts a JSON request containing user details and securely hashes the password before storing it in the database. If the registration is successful, it returns a 201 Created response with the user's information (excluding the password). If the request body is invalid or an error occurs during registration, appropriate error messages are returned.

Request Example:
{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}

Response Example (Success - 201 Created):

{
  "statusText": "OK",
  "msg": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}

Response Example (Error - 400 Bad Request):

{
  "statusText": "Bad Request",
  "msg": "Invalid request body"
}

Response Example (Error - 500 Internal Server Error):

{
  "statusText": "Internal Server Error",
  "msg": "Error creating user",
  "error": "Database error details"
}

## POST /login
This endpoint allows registered users to log in. It validates the provided credentials against the database. If the username and password match, the server returns a 200 OK response with the user's details. If authentication fails, a 401 Unauthorized response is sent. Any database-related errors result in a 500 Internal Server Error.

Request Example:

{
  "username": "johndoe",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}

Response Example (Success - 200 OK):

{
  "statusText": "OK",
  "msg": "Login successful!",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "johndoe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}

Response Example (Error - 401 Unauthorized, Incorrect Credentials):

{
  "statusText": "Unauthorized",
  "msg": "Invalid username or password"
}

Response Example (Error - 400 Bad Request, Invalid Request Body):

{
  "statusText": "Bad Request",
  "msg": "Invalid request body"
}

Response Example (Error - 500 Internal Server Error):

Security Considerations:
Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage.

Users must provide correct credentials to authenticate.

Responses do not expose sensitive user data like hashed passwords.

Proper error handling prevents revealing sensitive database information.



## POST /addBook
This endpoint allows users to add a new book to the database. The request must contain the book's name and author in JSON format.
